**WEBSITE STILL IN DEVELOPEMENT**

# E-commerce-website
An dynamic E-commerce website is built by using django and REST-API 

  Here in my website you can create an user account for yourself. So Next time when you sign in, your credentials and user datas are stored in AWS Cloud and retrieved.
  Using python 'pillow' image processing is done to store and process product pictures, user profile pictures and more.
  Even you can add products to you cart and order you products, after you order you will be shown for the status of product transistion (~CRUD Operation)
